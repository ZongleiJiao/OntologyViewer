 * A PosInfo is used primarily to pass position info for shapes and constraint
 * widgets between the GUI and graph layout threads.  At the end of each layout
 * iteration, the PostIteration callback creates a list of PosInfos containing
 * the updated positions of all objects.  The GUI thread later calls process()
 * to handle the updated positions.  Optionally, processHUD may be called by
 * the GUI thread to draw a debug "Head Up Display" for the associated
 * shape/widget.  PosInfos can also be created by the GUI thread to tell the
 * layout thread that certain objects should be fixed at their current position
 * (these are processed by the layout thread by calling
 * fixGraphLayoutPosition().
