//! @brief   The ShapeRef class represents a shape object.
//!
//! Shapes are obstacles that connectors must be routed around.  They can be 
//! placed into a Router scene and can be repositioned or resized (via
//! Router::moveShape()).
//! 
//! Usually, it is expected that you would create a ShapeRef for each shape 
//! in your diagram and keep that reference in your own shape class.
//!

    public:
        //! @brief  Shape reference constructor.
        //!
        //! Creates a shape object reference, and adds it to the router
        //! scene.  This shape will be considered to be an obstacle.
        //! This will cause connectors intersecting the newly added shape
        //! to be marked as needing to be rerouted.
        //!
        //! If the router is using transactions, then changes will occur
        //! the next time Router::processTransaction() is called.  See
        //! Router::setTransactionUse() for more information.
        //!
        //! The shape can be moved with Router::moveShape() and removed
        //! from the scene and freed with Router::deleteShape().
        //!
        //! The poly argument will usually be the boundary of the shape in your 
        //! application with additional buffer of several pixels on each side.
        //! Specifying such a buffer results in connectors leaving a small 
        //! amount of space around shapes, rather than touching them on the 
        //! corners or edges.
        //!
        //! If an ID is not specified, then one will be assigned to the shape.
        //! If assigning an ID yourself, note that it should be a unique 
        //! positive integer.  Also, IDs are given to all objects in a scene,
        //! so the same ID cannot be given to a shape and a connector for 
        //! example.
        //!
        //! @param[in]  router  The router scene to place the shape into.
        //! @param[in]  poly    A Polygon representing the boundary of the 
        //!                     shape.
        //! @param[in]  id      A unique positive integer ID for the shape.
